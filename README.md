# net-computation-calculator
Calculate computational power needed for a given neural network.

[calculator.py](calculator.py) contains calculation for each operation / layer, and is served as basis for net calculation.

### Nets:

- ResNet50: [resnet50.py](resnet50.py)
- YOLO: [yolo.py](yolo.py)

Will continue to add calculations for more nets.
